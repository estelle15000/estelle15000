### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack developper and a linear programmer.
I really love Operational Research and maths solvers.
This is my main project, a graphical mathematical linear solver :
https://www.solvgraph.com
The SolvGraph project is a hard giant project and is really time consuming.
Feel free to add message in the solvgraph.com social network !

Bonjour, Biencenue sur mon GitHub, je ne publie pas car je travaille uniquement sur www.solvgraph.Com,
le solveur linÃ©aire mathÃ©matique en mode graphique.
